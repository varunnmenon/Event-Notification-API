# Event-Notification-API
# Introduction
This is an API that can be used to view the events near your location. You can also add events using the same API.
This API implements a publish subscribe model, where the a subscriber can subscribe to interested events and venues and publishers can add events using the application.
This API is still not perfect and needs some improvements and addition of more features to make it reliable.
